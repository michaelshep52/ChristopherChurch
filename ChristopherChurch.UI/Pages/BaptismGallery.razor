            <p>
                Jesus challenged his disciples to confess their faith before others
                and to walk before others as his disciples.
            </p>
            <p>
                "So everyone who acknowledges me before men,
                I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven,
                but whoever denies me before men,
                I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven." -Matthew 10 : 32-33
            </p>
            <p>
                "We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that,
                just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
                we too might walk in newness of life." -Romans 6 : 4
            </p>
            <p>
                "Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you,
                not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience,
                through the resurrection of Jesus Christ." -1 Peter 3 : 21
            </p>
            <p>
                Baptism presents an opportunity for all believers to publicly
                display that Jesus is their Lord and Savior.
